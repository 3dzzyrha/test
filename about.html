        <h1>About 3dzzyrha</h1>
        <p>I'm 3dzzyrha. I'm a new web developer. I'm learning how to create web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In a past life, I was a crossing guard at my local elementary school. While it was rewarding, I decided I didn't want to be out in the weather, whatever it may be, so I started to learn web development.</p>
        
        <p>I don't want to get stuck making web pages for my family for free, so please hire me!</p>
